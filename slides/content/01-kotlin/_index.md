# Why Kotlin

JetBrains-made modern programming language 
* Focused on "practical use" (whatever that means)

Gaining momentum since Google adopted is as *official Android language* (along with Java and C++)

Clearly inspired by a mixture of Java, C#, Scala, and Groovy

**In this course** -- we'll need it for Gradle and *internal* domain specific languages

# Philosophy: Kotlin vs. Scala

**Sca**_la_ is a **scalable** _language_
* Few core constructs that enable a huge variety of programming patterns
* Born in academia
* State of the art type checker with advanced features
    * Higher Kinded Types
    * Type lambdas
    * Enough to do type programming...

**Kotlin** is somewhat *a better java*
* Born in industry, for the industry
* Many more "core" constructs and keywords than Scala
* Focused on getting productive quickly and reducing programming errors
* Focus on multi-target (can compile towards JVM, JavaScript, and native)
    * Scala can as well by the way
    * Kotlin puts more care into bidirectional compatibility

# Kotlin 101
## Defining functions, constant, variables

Similar to Scala. The keyword `def` is replaced by `fun`
```kotlin
val x = 10 // constant
var y = 20 // variable, can be reassigned
fun foo() = 20 // function definition, single expression
fun bar(): Int { // same as above with multiple expression
    return 20 // requires a return in this form...
}
fun baz() { } // Unless it returns Unit

```

---

# Kotlin 101
## Function parameters and return types

Much like Scala:

* All parameters are named, but can be invoked positionally as well
* Parameters can have defaults
* Types are annotatedd after the parameter name
* Invocation can be positional or by name, with the rule that once a named parameter is used, subsequent parameters must be named as well

```kotlin
fun foo(a: Int = 0, b: String = "foo"): Int = TODO() // TODO() is a builtin function throwing a `NotImplementedError`
foo(1, "bar") // OK, positional
foo(a = 1, b = "bar") // OK, named
foo(1, b = "bar") // OK, hybrid
foo(a = 1, "bar") // error: no value passed for parameter 'b'
foo() // OK, both defaults
foo(1) // OK, same as foo(1, "foo")
foo("bar") // error: type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected
foo(b = "bar") // OK, same as foo(0, "bar")
```

---

# Kotlin 101
## Top level functions

Kotlin supports top level functions

```kotlin
fun foo() {
    ...
}
```

By contrast, Scala requires to put them in an `object`

```scala
object Foo {
    def foo() {
        ...
    }
}
```

When targeting the JVM, Kotlin simply generates a `FileNameKt` class behind the scenes where the function is stored.
The behaviour can be controlled via annotations.

# Kotlin 101
## Program entry point

Naming a function `main` makes it a valid entry point:

```kotlin
fun main() = println("Hello World") // Valid entry point
```
```kotlin
fun main(arguments: Array<String>) = println("Hello World") // Valid entry point
```
```kotlin
fun main(arguments: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello World") // Return type is Unit, no need to return
} 
```

---

# Kotlin 101
## Nullable types

Every Kotlin type exists in two forms: normal, and nullable (likely inspired by Ceylon).
<br/>
Nullable types are suffixed by a `?` and require special handling
<br/>
`null` can't be assigned to non nullable types!
* Nullables are the Kotlin way to deal with `Option` types

```kotlin
var foo = "bar" // Okay, type is String
var baz: String? = foo // Okay, normal types can be assigned to nullables
foo = baz // error: type mismatch: inferred type is String? but String was expected
foo = null // error: null can not be a value of a non-null type String
```

---

# Kotlin 101
## Accessing nullable types

Nullable types memebers can't be accessed by `.`.
```kotlin
var baz: String? = "foo"
baz.length // error: only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed...
// on a nullable receiver of type String?
```

### Safe call operator `?.`
Performs runtime access to a member of a nullable object if it's not `null`, otherwise returns `null`
* Somewhat similar to Scala's `Option`'s `map` (but no monad involved)
```kotlin
var baz: String? = "foo"
baz?.length // returns 3, return type is "Int?", in fact...
val bar: Int = baz?.length // ...error: type mismatch: inferred type is Int? but Int was expected
baz = null
baz?.length // returns null, return type is still "Int?"
```

---

# Kotlin 101

### Non-null assertion `!!`
Also known as: *I want my code to break badly at runtime*
<br/>
* Invalidates the whole point of having nullable types by asserting that the nullable object is not `null` at runtime
* It should be **never** used
    * In fact its ugly syntax is so *ugly by purpose*

```kotlin
var baz: String? = "foo"
baz!! // Returns "foo", type String (non nullable)
baz!!.length // returns 3, return type is Int
baz = null
baz!! // throws a KotlinNullPointerException, like the good ol'times!
```

---

# Kotlin 101

### Elvis operator `?:`
Yeah it's actually named after Elvis Presley due to his haircut ðŸ˜‰
<br/>
* Returns the left operand if it's not `null`, otherwise the right one

```kotlin
var baz: String? = "foo"
baz ?: "bar" // Returns "foo", type String
baz?.length ?: 0 // returns 3, return type is Int
baz = null
baz ?: "bar" // Returns "bar", type String
baz?.length ?: 0 // returns 0, return type is Int
```

---

# Kotlin 101

## Platform types
Kotlin targets the JVM, JavaScript, and native code
<br/>
*None of them has nullable types!*

Nullability is unknown for types coming from the target platform, how to deal with them?
1. {{< frag c="Always consider them nullable (safe, but very unpleasant)" >}}
1. {{< frag c="Always consider them non nullable (code is lightweight and nice, but unsafe)" >}}

---

# Kotlin 101

## Platform types
Kotlin considers all foreign values whose nullability is unknown as *platform types*
* Their type is suffixed by `!` (e.g., `java.util.Date!`)
* At first use, their type is *implicitly disambiguated* (either nullable or non-nullable)
    * Namely, platform types can be used as non-nullable...
* Runtime nullability checks are put in place by the compiler (*fail fast!*)
    * ...but their actual nullablity is checked at use-site
* Platform types *can't be created* in Kotlin! They only come from interaction with "platform code"
* If the target platform offers some way to assert nullability, Kotlin tries to use it
    * e.g., if a Java method/parameter is annotated with `@NotNull` (or similar common alternatives) it will be interpreted as a non-nullable type
